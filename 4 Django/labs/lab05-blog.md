# Lab 5: Blog

Let's create a blog with a user system and image uploads.


## Part 1: User System

Create the following pages:

- Register `/register/`
  - form for creating a new user
  - redirect to `/profile/` after registering
- Login `/login/`
  - form for logging a user in
  - redirect to `/profile/` after logging in
- Profile `/profile/`
  - a protected page only logged in users can see
  - just show a welcome message for now

## Part 2: List Blog Posts & Create Blog Post

Create the following model:

- BlogPost
  - title (`CharField`)
  - body (`TextField`)
  - image (`ImageField`)
  - user (`ForeignKey` to `django.contrib.auth.models.User`)
  - public (`BooleanField`)

Create the following pages:

- Profile `/profile/`
  - show a list of the user's own posts, only showing the title of each
- Create Post `/create/`
  - form for creating a new post


## Part 3: Edit Post

Allow users to edit their `BlogPost`s by creating an edit page. Make sure you prevent users from editing eachother's blog posts (make sure the `id` for the blog post passed in via the path corresponds to a `BlogPost` for the logged-in `User`).

- Edit Post `/edit/<int:blogpost_id>/`
  - form for editing an existing post

## Part 4: View Other Posts

Add pages for users to browse each other's posts.

- List of Posts `/posts/`
  - list posts by all users
- Post Detail `/posts/<int:blogpost_id>/`
  - view a blog post
